It looks like this page talks about overall document structure

## 1. Compiler

**pdflatex** (maybe xelatex)

- It looks like the default for overleaf and for R studio is pdfLaTex but XeLaTex can also be used for both. Xelatex may be better for certain unicode fonts, but I'll probably want to stick with the default, and just change the language to Spanish.

## 2. Citation package manager

**Biblatex**

- Looks like it can be used for Spanish quite well, see the code in this answer,
for the code that would need to be in the latex preamble (remember YAML hearders can also contain certain options options)

- Consider also

- Better than apacite for Spanish:

> Since this is for a thesis (and the apacite package is not being required by a particular journal) you might also consider using biblatex and the biblatex-apa package, which is a very up-to-date implementation of the APA 6th edition. There are plenty of examples of its use on the site. (https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/37046/151573)


## 3. Document structure

- **Child = option in R markdown chunks** 
Doing this will allow chapters to be stored in separate Rmd Files

## 4. Portada
- Looks like IIL has a template which is part of CTAN.ORG:
