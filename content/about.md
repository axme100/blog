Welcome! You have made it to my **brand new** personal website and blog. I will be using this site to blog about my personal and professional interests, which include linguistics (applied linguistics, hispanic linguistics, sociolinguistics, language teaching, phonetics/phonology, lexicography *among others*), coding, data anaylsis, and outdoor education (just to name a few!).

You can find my CV here.

I created this static webpage using the blogdown package in R. Shout out to <a href="https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/tutorial/blogdown-tutorial-part-1/" target=blank>this blog for walking me through the steps.
