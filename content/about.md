This is my new blog. I'll be using this site to write about my personal and professional interests, which include linguistics (applied linguistics, hispanic linguistics, sociolinguistics, language teaching, phonetics/phonology, lexicography *among others*), web dev, data anaylsis, and outdoor education (just to name a few!).
