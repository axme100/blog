Welcome! You've landed on my **brand new** personal website and blog. I'll be using this site to blog about my personal and professional interests, which include linguistics (applied linguistics, hispanic linguistics, sociolinguistics, language teaching, phonetics/phonology, lexicography *among others*), web dev, data anaylsis, and outdoor education (just to name a few!).

On this site you can find blog posts about the latest projects I have been working on including my Master's Thesis.

Also, you can find a one page resume
