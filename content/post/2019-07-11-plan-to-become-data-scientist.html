<p>Testing</p>
<p>The purpose of this blog post is to plan for and document the steps that I am currently undertaking to prepare for a career in data science and/or computational linguistics/natural language processing. I have a background in academic linguistics: sociolinguistics, Spanish linguistics, applied linguistics. I <strong>love</strong> these fields and enjoyed teaching English and Spanish (applied linguistics) for a number of years. However, jobs in academia are quite scarce these days, so I decided to re-train for a career in language technology.</p>
<p>I thought I would nerd out on a roadmap of my current MOOC journey to retool for a career these fields. My plan is to use this blog to keep track of my progress, stay motivated, take notes, and hopefully, inspire others to follow a similar path. Of course, I will also be codecrastinating around with html-css-javascript (just for fun)! If you have any comments, thoughts, suggestions, please use Disques at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2>Algebra and Trigonometry (Precalculus)</h2>
<p><span class="math display">\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\]</span></p>
<p>I have had some college-level training in algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics, however, I only took 1 class in each field, and the classes were designed for business majors which meant they lacked certain topics, especially revolving around trigonometry.</p>
<p>The first step in my plan is to brush up on algebra and precalculus, using EdX classes. The great thing about these courses is that they use ALEKS, an online learning platform that uses an AI algorithm to predict what you already know and give you an individualized path to mastering the content. <a href="https://sway.office.com/tFxqIGwGLW6DmseU" target=blank> This blog </a> explains the pros and cons of Khan Academy vs. ALEKS, arguing that Khan academy is better because of the superior gamification and positive user reinforcement built into the platform. However, for people like me, adult learners, whose interest and commitement in math waxed and waned throughout high school and college, I mastered certain topics but always had certain holes in my knowledge. Thus, I think the <a href="https://www.aleks.com/video/how_aleks_works" target=blank>AI behind ALEKS</a> will really help me focus on the things I don’t already know and learn the content faster, Khan academy doesn’t create an individualized path for each learner (at least not that I know). Anyway, ALEKS let’s you click on a button to watch videos for certain topics when you get stuck, some of which are Khan Academy, and others are from Arizona State University, the institution behind the MOOCs:</p>

<p>Although my experience with ALEKS was great for the reasons I described above, at times the videos by Arizona State University were a bit robotic and dry. I often needed some more detailed explanations of certain topics, esepcially trigonometry. Here are some of the gems that I found:</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpXKiFjXjc&t=188s" target=blank> How to derive the unit circle </a> using special right triangles. This comes from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59w9x18hNNELpDvmo1UhVQ" target=blank> Simple Math </a> Youtube Channel which I highly reccomend.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW6Ua50fTw8&t=208s" target=blank> Memorize the first quadrant of unit cirlce and derive the rest by reflecting </a> (Brian McLogan) In this video, Mr. Brian Mclogan, explains how to memorize the first quadrant of the unit circle and then just derive the other points using reflections.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/analytictrigonometry/" target=blank> Trigonometry Your Complete Guide </a> (Brian Mclogan). After working my way through this class, I had a solid foundation in trig and the problems on identities became easier to understand. Brian McLogans’ videos (see above) are fantastic and many are available for free on You Tube.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOR1BiPyOkkIAnv9Cmj4iw" target=blank> Mario’s Math Tutoring You Tube Channel </a> I have ran into a couple gems here too! But I haven’t explored the channel as much as the ones above.</p></li>

Often times I found it helpful to look up a concept in a Kahn Academy article instead of a video, just appending “kahn article” to your google search should do the trick. For example, when working on factoring trigonometric identities, looking up the difference of squares method brought me to this excellent article:</p></li>

</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>
There are many different ways to factor polynomials, (a) the sum-product method, (b) the a*c method, (c) completing the square method, (d) the quadratic formula method, (e) using variable replacement or u-substitution, (f) factor by grouping (e) solving it graphically, (f) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/science/quadratic-equations-algebra.html" target="blank"> this method </a> that got a lot of PR in the New York Times recently used method that I read about in the New York Times (see link below). As a student of Math, I’m looking for a consise or rule-of-thumb explanation of when to use each of these formulas. When looking at a polynomial, how can I know which method(s) to use.</li>

<p>Work in progress attemp at creating such an algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the leading coeficient is greater than 1, check for (a) and if you fail use (d) or (e). If the leading coeficient is greater than 1, then try (b), else use (d) or (e).</p>

<p>The next step is to take calculus classes. In college, I took a business calculus class, and loved it. However, it was only a 10-week course that focused mostly on derivatives (we only looked at integrals for 1 week). I can see that calculus is quite important for data science, according to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/mathematics-for-data-science-e53939ee8306" target=blank>this blog:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Calculus is] used in machine learning (&amp;deep learning) to formulate the funcions used to train algorithms to rech their objective, known by loss/cost/objective functions”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have also heard that integrals are key to understanding probability, the area under a curve represents the probability of something. Also, it looks like most people pursuing a B.S. need to have 3 foundational courses in calculus before moving on to more advanced topics. I am really excited to see that MIT offeres just this content on edX:</p>

<p>I thought it would be a good idea to practice counting (using the multiplication principle and the binomial coeficient) would be to calculute poker hands.) <a href="https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~shopkins/classes/4707/poker_hands.pdf" target=blank> Here </a> is a good reource that has already done this and I can compare my answers.</p>

This first way I thought about this probability was, 13 possible demoniations of cards, imagine being somewhere on the multiplication principle tree say, for 7. Then we have 4 choose 2 possible ways of getting a pair for that demoniation. Then assuming we have a pair, there are 50 chose 3 more cards remaining. It appears this answer was wrong.</li>

This guy has a lot of free lectures on different math classes which he gives at an excellent pace for my level of understanding. The probability lectures seem great, so far I’ve only watched the videos on sets and set theory.</p></li>
<li><p>Stat 110 Lectures on Youtube. These lectures complement the edX class but are not a required part of this class. <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube" class="uri">https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube</a></p></li>

<li>Shoul dcome back and look at the other vieos this guy has.</li>
</ul>
<p>My story is first choose 2 spaids out of the 13 spaids, then choose the remaining 3 cards from all the hands that do not have sapids (52-13spaids). Divide that by all the possible hands.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(choose(13,2)*choose(39,3))/choose(52,5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.2742797</code></pre>
<p>Use the same logic to calculate a one of a kind or a two of a kind or a three of a kind.</p>

<p>we could first choose the team captain and then choose the remaining 𝑘−1 team members; this gives the left-hand side. Equivalently, we could first choose the 𝑘 team members and then choose one of them to be captain; this gives the right-hand side.</p>
