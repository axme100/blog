<p>The purpose of this blog post is to plan for and document the steps that I am currently undertaking to prepare for a career in data science and/or computational linguistics. I have a background in academic linguistics: sociolinguistics, hispanic linguistics, applied linguistics (you can see my publications and CV here). I <strong>love</strong> these fields and enjoyed teaching English and Spanish (applied linguistics) for a number of years. However, jobs in academia are quite scarce these days, so my ultimate goal is to find a job in industry where I can combine my love for language and linguistics with technology.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a lot of the skills I picked up in linguistics, like data anaylsis with R, are useful for a career data science and computational linguistics. This is my roadmap to retool for a career in data science and/or computational linguistics.</p>

<h1>Step 1: Refresh and upgrade math and statistics knowledge</h1>
<p>I have had some college-level training in algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics, however, I only took 1 class in each field, and the classes were designed for business majors which meant they lacked certain topics, like geometry. In other words, they were not sufficiently comprehensive to understand the math behind topics like machine learning and AI.</p>
<div id="step-1a-comprehensive-algebra-and-precalculus-review" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1a) Comprehensive Algebra and Precalculus Review</h2>
<p>The first step in my plan is to brush up on algebra and precalculus, using EdX classes. The great thing about these courses is that they use an AI system, ALEKS, to detect what you already know and give you an individualized path to mastering the content. For people like me whose interest in math waxed and waned throughout high school and college, I mastered certain topics but always had holes in my knowledge. This is helping brush up on and fill the wholes of my foundational math knowledge.</p>

<h2>Step 1b): Calculus</h2>
<p>The next step is to take a calculus class. In college, I took a business calculus class, and loved it (I also aced it). However, it was only a 10-week course that focused mostly on derivatives (we only looked at integrals for 1 week). I can see that calculus is quite important for data science, according to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/mathematics-for-data-science-e53939ee8306" target=blank>this blog:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Calculus is] used in machine learning (&amp;deep learning) to formulate the funcions used to train algorithms to rech their objective, known by loss/cost/objective functions”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>also, integrasl It looks like most people pursuing a B.S. need to have 3 foundational courses in calculus before moving on to more advanced topics. I am really excited to see that MIT offeres these foundational classes on edX.</p>
