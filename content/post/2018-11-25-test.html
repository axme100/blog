<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this post, I’m going to show off my first full-stack, data viz web application that allows you to visualize usage data of the <a href="https://www.totago.com" target=blank>Totago</a>, an online program for helping people to access hiking trails via public transportation. My application is an interactive, choropleth map where each map area is colored according to the number of users who generated Totago iteneraries from that area. When users click on thee map areas (postal codes or neighborhoods), information about the destinations originaing from the areas is displayed dynamically through resizing cirlces on the map as well as an adjacent bar graph.</p>

<p>You can find the live version of the application <a href="https://nameless-sierra-49126.herokuapp.com/map/" target=blank>here</a> (hosted on Heroku).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the code is located in <a href="https://github.com/turnofftheapp/mapProj" target=blank>this GitHub repository</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The application, hosted on Heroku, uses Python and Flask for the backend code and connects to a Postgres database hosted on AWS RDS with SQL Alchemy. The front retrieves data via AJAX calls which is visualized by a in the map element (powered by Map Box GL JS) and a a bar graph (Mapbox GL JS). You can find all the source code in the link above.</p>

<h1>1. It’s very important to have a mentor during the development process</h1>
<p>Even though this project is a single-page application, it took me a <strong>long</strong> time, but it would have taken much longer without the support of Adrian Laurenzi Totago founder and CEO (<a href="http://adrianlaurenzi.com/my-cv/" target=blank>here is a link to his personal site</a>) . When I started this project (as a freelance gig), Adrian invited me to Totago’s slack channel and we made a point of getting in touch at least once a week.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned at Udacity, was the importance of planning out your code before jumping in. I found it particularly helpful to have</p>

<h1>4. Stack Overflow is God!</h1>
<p>This project has taught me a lot about the value in being good at copying-and-pasting from Stack Overflow. Really though, I don’t think of it as control-Cing and control-Ving your homework because it really does take some skill to know (a) how to phrase your question correctly on Google, (b) how to sift through the different posts and answers within stack overflow, and (c) how to make fine-tune or coarse adjustments to the code you find on the forums. For example, I knew I needed to find a way to create GeoJSON circles for each Totago destination in my project, to do this I googled something like</p>
