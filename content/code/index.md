# Overview
The purpose of this page is to collect scripts, snippets of code, notes, and ideas. Getting things written down help me to stay more organized, and hopefully something here can be adopted by others!

# R Scripts
1. [Wrangle Concordances and Apply Custom Function]( {{< ref "codeOne">}})
This script reads in a bunch of excel files of concordance lines in Spanish, aggregates them, and applies a custom function to trim the `left context` field, it specifically trims everything to the left of the last full stop. Plus top 10 ggplot bar graph!

# Code Notes:
2. [Compiling MA Thesis in Latex with R Markdown in Spanish]( {{< ref "codeTwo">}})
These are notes that I'm using to resarch the best way to compile my MA thesis in Spanish using Rmarkdown, knitr, latex.
